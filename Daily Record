Introduction to Data structures
1. What are data structures?
- A way of organising and storing data in a computer or a program
- Help manipulate and manage data efficiently
2. What is an algorithm?
- A set of well-defined instructions, step by step guidelines designed to solve a problem or do particular task
3. Relationships between data structures and algorithms
- they are complement like nouns and verbs
4. Why we use data strucutres?
- help solving difficult problems
- better organisation 
- improve efficiency
- avoid security risks
- optimize memory usages
5. How to use in real project?(how to design algorithm well)
- 1) Understand the problem
- 2) Identify solution
- 3) Identify what data structures to be used
- 4) Implement program
- 5) Check if it works
- 6) cHECK IF it's efficient
- Step 3) and 6) will be dealt with this book.
